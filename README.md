# Burglar Alert system using PIR sensor Arduino UNO 
IoT Internship completion project 
### Project Report
The project problem statement is **Create a burglar alarm â€“ detect motion of a person (using a PIR sensor) and If there is motion, ring the buzzer (using Arduino UNO).**
### Components required for this project
- PIR sensor (Passive Infrared Sensor) 
- Arduino UNO board
- Buzzer
### Component Discription
- **PIR Senosor:** It is a special type of sensor which is usually used for security purposes. It detects the objects by reading the Infrared radiations emitted by the objects. Any object whose temperature is above absolute zero, emits radiation.
This radiation is not visible to human eyes. The PIR sensor is designed to detect this Infrared radiation. A PIR motion sensor has a pair of pyro electric sensors to detect heat energy from the
surrounding environment. It helps generate an electrical signal when they are heated or cooled.

- **Arduino UNO:** Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a
piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.
The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, and for good reason. Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does
not need a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board -- you can simply use a USB cable. Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified
version of C++, making it easier to learn to program. Finally, Arduino provides a standard form factor that breaks out the functions of the micro-controller into a more accessible
package.
